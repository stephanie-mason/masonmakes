        <div class="pov">I made a persistance of vision kit from Adafruit and fucked around with it for awhile, which was fun.</div>

        <div class="pigrrl">I also made a pigrrl from another Adafruit kit. It was fun to build but kind of lackluster to play with so I disassembled it and used the components for other projects.</div>
        <div class="pigrrl"><img src="images/electronics/pigrrl_01.jpg" alt="The open innards of a pi girl. One half of the case is translucent orange, and contains a few pcb boards. It is connected to a screen, contained in a solid white back case, by a cable ribbon."></div>

        <div class="doll">I briefly got really obsessed with doll "face-ups" and wanted to start doing doll repaints myself. I did one repaint, which turned out pretty good, and was then over it.</div>

She has two dogs following her down the path, and at the end of the path is a tiny house on a trailer with her partner, Jason and a few more chickens next to it. There is text at the bottom of the illustration that reads, 'a blog of creative endeavors.'"></div>

        <div class="other">I painted this bird on a tent I made. It's a pitohui, which is a poisonous bird.</div>

      <p> My name is Stephanie Mason. I like to try new things and to challenge myself. I am very interested in interdisciplinary work of all kinds. I am especially keen on the intersections between art, science, and design.</p>

      <p> I have worked, for various lengths of time, as a research assistant, a web developer, a knitting store associate, a contortionist, an independent designer, a studio assistant, an artist, a teacher, and a house painter. I currently make a living doing bioinformatics research and web development.</p>

      <p> I am also a student at Western Washington University, finishing a BS in Biology and Mathematics with minors in Computer Science and Chemistry. I currently have plans on going to graduate school to work towards getting a PhD. I also have a BA in Linguistics.</p>
